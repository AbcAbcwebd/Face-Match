This application finds people who look like you. It uses Microsoft Azure facial recognition. 

Created by Alec Schleicher and Caroline Bowes (backend and database management) and Owen Essen (front end).

To run locally: 
```npm start local```

Due to high maintenance costs, the full site is no longer active. However you can check out a view demo here:

You can also check out a live version of the front end (with facial recognition technology off) here:
